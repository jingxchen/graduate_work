I am going to have 4 semesters in the master program of applied stats in umich. The first semester I have taken 3 courses which are STATS 500 Linear Regression, STATS 506 Computational methods and tools in statistics, STATS 510 Probability and mathematical statistics.
I will upload some of my coursework here to store and memory them. Hope I can be better and better.
